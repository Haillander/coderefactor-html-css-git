# HTML, CSS and Git: Code Refactor

This week task was to review and refactor existing HTML and CSS code to meet accessibility standards and meet the marketing agency's acceptance criteria.

## Questions/Challenges

- I got this project as a challenge and i was focus from the beginning to the end.
My motivation it was to leaning how to refactor codes and also to make a clean code.

- I have done the review refactor existing to meet accessability standard to meet the marketing Agency's criteria
 
- Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

- Working on this project i have learned how CSS class attributes works and also refactoring html with semantic elements.

I originally had the alt tag in the service sections with the same text as the headers, when using an accessibility tool.

I got a comment that the alt tag for the services were redundant so i change this to describe what was taking place in the images. Can you please tell me what is better practice? Following the section titles or description of the image?
